This material provides the scripts and datasets necessary to reproduce the examples presented in the **Plant Image Analysis Course**, offered as part of NEPEM’s internal training program

# Software

To reproduce the examples in this material, you will need the latest versions o R and RStudio (Portuguese).

<a class="btn btn-success" href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-save"></i> Download R</a>

<a class="btn btn-success" href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-save"></i> Download RStudio</a>

# Restoring the R environment with renv
This command will install all required packages with the exact versions recorded in the `renv.lock` file. 


```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("renv")
renv::activate()
renv::restore()
```



If you later add new packages, run:
```{r eval = FALSE}
renv::install("pliman")
renv::snapshot(type = "all")
```



# Citation

[![](paper.png)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13803)

To cite the pliman package in your works, use the following reference:

>  Olivoto T (2022). “Lights, camera, pliman! An R package for plant image analysis.” **Methods in Ecology
  and Evolution**, 13(4), 789-798. doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13803 <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13803>.

```{r}
citation("pliman")
```

# Scripts

The .zip file contains a folder with the static website, structured as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(fs)
fs::dir_tree("D:/Desktop/UFSC/NEPEM/capacitações/capacitacao_imganalise", recurse = 1)
```

The material in HTML (\_site/index.html) will give you access to the site, where you can view all examples, with codes and outputs. To reproduce the material, simply use the \*.qmd files.

For reproduction, it is suggested to set the `htp_cbmp2025` folder as the default directory. You can easily set the directory by running the following command, assuming you have the `00_about.qmd` script open.

```{r eval=FALSE}
pliman::set_wd_here()
```
